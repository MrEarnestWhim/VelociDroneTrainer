# VelociDroneTrainer

This program is designed for automatic recovery of a quadcopter after a crash or damage. Since restarting a race requires pressing a button on the keyboard or your controller twice, the button may eventually fail. This program is designed to save your input devices and not distract you with unnecessary actions in the simulator.

### In console:
1. ``git clone https://github.com/MrEarnestWhim/VelociDroneTrainer.git``
2. ``cd VelociDroneTrainer``
3. ``python3 -m venv venv``
4. ``source venv/bin/activate`` (for Linux) | ``venv/Scripts/activate.bat`` (for Windows)
5. ``python start.py``
6. go to the game!)

_It's software in development..._
